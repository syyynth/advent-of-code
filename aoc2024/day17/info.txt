part1: simulate the program
part2: the correctness is questionable, but it worked for me
       first, with brute force observe that the length of the 'program' is 8^something + some noise for full match
       educated guess(probably):
        - try to match the suffix at len(program)-1..len(program) with increments by 1
        - multiply this number by 8
        - try to match the suffix at len(program)-2..len(program) with increments by 1
        - repeat for the whole 'program'
will take A LOT OF TIME for some inputs
